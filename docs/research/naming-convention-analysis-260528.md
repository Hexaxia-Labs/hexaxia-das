## Context

Following the nav test benchmark (see `nav-test-findings-260528.md`), three corpora were compared:

- **original** — pre-DAS mixed convention
- **descriptive** — clean alphabetical folders, `{type}-{subject}` filenames, no numeric prefixes
- **das** — current DAS format `{address}-HXT-{client}-{descriptor}-{YYMMDD}.ext`

The descriptive corpus performed 30% worse than DAS on agent navigation (99.7 vs 75.3 avg turns). This prompted a systematic analysis of what each naming element actually contributes.

## Signal Analysis — Three Lenses

| Element | ML / Agent | Human | RAG Hybrid |
|---|---|---|---|
| Numeric address prefix | **Critical.** Acts as jump table — agents immediately discard irrelevant areas. +30% regression without it. | Learnable. Not intuitive at first, but consistent once mapped. | Routing key via `das_address` in passport. Filename numeric prefix reinforces the signal. |
| Type slug in filename | **Helpful.** Agent can characterize doc type from `ls` without reading file. Proven in Q6-class questions. | **Immediately useful.** Scan any folder and know what you're looking at. | Appears in RAG result snippets — reinforces semantic match. |
| Optional tag (corpus vocabulary) | Mixed. Helps targeted queries (Q4 enumeration: 13.0 → 11.3 turns with tags). Hurts broad navigation (Q1: 14.3 → 18.3, Q3: 14.0 → 16.7) — adds tokens to every `ls` line. Net: use sparingly on docs that travel out of context. | **Useful when file travels out of context** — git log, search results, email attachments. Not needed for every file. | Tag codes are short and distinct — unlikely to distort RAG matching. |
| Date in filename | Noise. No navigation or routing value. | Noise. Makes files look stale. Accumulates over time. | Noise. Passport `created`/`modified` fields own this. |
| HXT / org prefix | Noise. Every file in a single-org corpus already belongs to that org. | Noise. | Noise. |
| Passport summary | N/A (summary lives in the passport block, not the filename). | N/A. | **The actual retrieval signal.** Quality of the `summary` field determines RAG accuracy — not the filename. |

**Net conclusion:** address, type slug, and optional tag earn their place. Dates and org prefix are noise handled better elsewhere. Additional classification beyond one tag belongs in the passport.

## Adopted Format

```
{address}-[{TAG}-]{type}-{descriptor}.ext
```

| Token | Rules |
|---|---|
| `{address}` | DAS dotted numeric address (e.g., `02.01.04`). Required. |
| `{TAG}` | One optional tag from the corpus vocabulary defined in `das.config.yaml`. Uppercase 2-5 chars. Use when the file is regularly seen out of context and the address alone doesn't provide enough signal. |
| `{type}` | Controlled vocabulary slug (see below). Required. |
| `{descriptor}` | 2-4 word kebab-case subject. Specific enough to match likely search terms — do not over-truncate. No articles, conjunctions, dates, or org codes. |

### Original vs adopted

```
02.01.04-HXT-ULS-netbird-ztna-deployment-260509.md  →  02.01.04-ULS-runbook-netbird-ztna-deploy.md
07.08-HXT-hexpublish-product-spec-260426.md          →  07.08-spec-hexpublish.md
04.05.02.03-HXT-quiet-erosion-260512.md              →  04.05.02.03-post-quiet-erosion.md
03.07.02-HXT-shine-distributors-260518.md            →  03.07.02-TT-lead-shine-distributors.md
07.07-HXT-security-compliance-product-catalog.md     →  07.07-catalog-security-compliance.md
04.06-HXT-playbook-web-discovery.md                  →  04.06-playbook-web-discovery.md
```

Tag is applied selectively — client-scoped and market-scoped docs benefit; internal admin and product docs typically don't need it.

**Tag guidance from das-v3 test:** Apply tags to docs that regularly surface in git log, search results, tickets, or email — where the address hierarchy isn't visible. Do not tag broadly: each tagged file adds parsing cost to every `ls` scan of its folder.

## Type Vocabulary

Hard cap at 15 types — now in spec section 5.4. Anything that doesn't fit forces a naming decision rather than accumulating drift.

| Type | Use |
|---|---|
| `runbook` | Operational procedure, step-by-step execution guide |
| `plan` | Project plan or roadmap |
| `spec` | Product or technical specification |
| `design` | Design document or architecture |
| `strategy` | Business or practice strategy |
| `playbook` | Sales or marketing playbook |
| `proposal` | Client proposal |
| `contract` | Legal agreement |
| `report` | Findings, analysis, or audit output |
| `catalog` | Product or service catalog |
| `lead` | Sales lead record |
| `post` | Social media post |
| `template` | Reusable document template |
| `reference` | Reference material — informational, not actionable |
| `procedure` | Formal SOP |

## Resolved Questions

### 1. Client code — resolved via tag vocabulary

The original question was binary: drop the client code or keep it. The spec resolves this more cleanly with an optional tag vocabulary. Client codes are one use of the tag slot — not a special feature. A file that travels out of context (git log, search result, email attachment) gets a tag if the address alone is ambiguous. A file that stays in context doesn't need one.

`02.01.04-ULS-runbook-netbird-ztna-deploy.md` — tag justified; this surfaces in git log, tickets, handoff emails.  
`07.08-spec-hexpublish.md` — no tag needed; product is clear from the `07.08-HexPublish` folder.

The tag vocabulary in `das.config.yaml` defines valid codes for the corpus. Any dimension can be a tag — client, market, product, team — as long as it's in the vocabulary.

### 2. Type slug — CONFIRMED

DAS v2 corpus test result: Q6 (structural orientation) dropped from 13.3 turns (das) to 9.7 (das-v2), matching the original corpus baseline. The type slug lets agents characterise document type from `ls` output without opening files. Aggregate performance is neutral. Type slug is now required in spec section 5.2.

### 3. Folder naming — resolved, no change

`02-Clients/02.01-ULS/02.01.04-Projects/` (Title-Cased labels) stays. Mixed-case labels are visually distinct from lowercase files in `ls` output. No change proposed.

## Corpus Test Results

### DAS v2 — `{address}-{type}-{descriptor}.ext`

- Same content, passports, manifest as DAS corpus
- 3 runs, 8 questions
- Aggregate: 78.7 turns vs 75.3 das — neutral (within variance)
- Q6 structural orientation: **9.7 vs 13.3** — confirmed improvement (-27%)
- Q1 deep lookup: 14.3 vs 7.0 — regression (descriptor truncation: "netbird-ztna-deployment" → "netbird-ztna")
- All other questions: neutral

Build script: `~/Projects/das-nav-test/build-das-v2.py`

### DAS v3 — `{address}-[{TAG}-]{type}-{descriptor}.ext`

- Same as v2 with tags applied selectively: `ULS` on 02.01.xx, `PN` on 02.02.xx, `TT`/`IN` on market leads
- 3 runs, 8 questions
- Aggregate: 85.0 turns vs 78.7 das-v2 — **worse** (+8%)
- Q4 enumeration: **11.3 vs 13.0** das-v2 — tag confirms client scope from `ls`, fewer opens
- Q6 structural: **9.7** — holds das-v2 gain, no regression
- Q8 misrouting: **5.3 vs 6.7** das-v2 — tag reduces false-positive folder exploration
- Q1 direct lookup: 18.3 vs 14.3 das-v2 — tag adds parsing cost on broad scans
- Q3 cross-area: 16.7 vs 14.0 das-v2 — same effect

**Verdict:** Tag is a human/out-of-context feature, not an in-corpus navigation feature. It earns its place for docs that travel; it costs turns for docs that stay in context. Use selectively.

## Forward-Looking: Passport + SQL Searches

The passport block carries structured metadata — `type`, `status`, `tags`, `das_address`, `created`, `modified`, `client`, `classification` — that maps cleanly to relational columns. As agent workflows mature, the same passport fields that drive RAG address routing today become the schema for SQL-style filtering:

```sql
SELECT das_address, title, status
FROM corpus
WHERE type = 'runbook' AND tags @> ['uls'] AND status = 'active'
```

The type vocabulary defined above is the first step toward that schema. Each controlled type becomes a discrete filter dimension. The `summary` field that drives RAG retrieval becomes the full-text column.

This is out of scope while the ML/human balance is still being calibrated — the naming convention and passport quality need to stabilize first. But the design choice to use a controlled type vocabulary (vs. freeform tags) already serves both the human readability goal today and the SQL query layer later. Worth keeping in mind when finalizing the type list.

## Status

All decisions incorporated into `docs/spec.md` v0.2.

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| Drop dates from filenames | **In spec** — passport `created`/`modified` owns this |
| Drop HXT / org prefix for single-org corpora | **In spec** — `org` field optional, noted as noise for single-org use |
| Keep numeric address prefix | **In spec** — proven critical, +30% regression without it |
| Add type slug (required) | **In spec §5.2, §5.4** — DAS v2 test: Q6 13.3 → 9.7 turns, neutral aggregate |
| Keep descriptors specific (not over-truncated) | **In spec §5.3 rule 3** — Q1 regression traced to truncation |
| Client code → optional tag vocabulary | **In spec §4, §5.2, §5.3** — corpus-defined `tags:` block, one optional tag per file. DAS v3 test: tag helps targeted enumeration (Q4 -2 turns) but costs broad navigation (Q1 +4, Q3 +3). Use selectively. |
| Controlled type vocabulary (15 types) | **In spec §5.4** — hard cap, new types require explicit addition |
| Passport as SQL schema foundation | Noted — out of scope until naming stabilizes |
